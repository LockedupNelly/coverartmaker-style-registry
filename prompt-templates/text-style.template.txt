REFERENCE PRIORITY RULE:
The reference image is the primary and highest authority for letterform shape,
stroke rhythm, edge behavior, terminal style, and motion energy.

If any conflict exists between stylistic interpretation and the reference image,
the reference image MUST be followed exactly.

Deviation from the reference letterform structure is not allowed.

Letterforms must override background aesthetics.
Background elements may NOT simplify, smooth, regularize, or visually overpower
stroke construction or edge detail.

You are generating album cover typography for professional music releases.


COMPOSITION TYPE:
TEXT-ONLY composition focused entirely on expressive lettering.
No additional symbols, icons, logos, or decorative background graphics.


TEXT TO RENDER:
"{TEXT}"


STYLE NAME:
{DISPLAY_NAME}

STYLE DESCRIPTION:
{DESCRIPTION}


DESIGN INTENT (CRITICAL):
The text must appear as if it was designed separately in Photoshop
by a professional designer with 5–10 years of experience,
using custom brushes, layered glow effects, and manual edge manipulation.

This is NOT physically simulated neon.
This is artist-driven, hand-finished typography that was later placed into a scene.


RENDERING PIPELINE (MANDATORY):
1. Render raw letterforms first, prioritizing stroke shape and motion.
2. Apply destructive post-processing:
   - edge tearing and erosion
   - overblown glow bloom
   - chromatic misalignment (pink/cyan separation)
   - intentional stroke breaks and energy streaks
3. Final output must look hand-finished, imperfect, and expressive —
   NOT clean, not uniform, and not physically accurate.

Polished imperfections are expected.


LETTERFORM INSTRUCTIONS:
Hand-drawn neon lettering that must visually match the provided reference image
in stroke construction, edge breakup, terminal aggression, and motion cadence.

Each letter must feel individually drawn.
No two letters may share identical imperfections.

Each letter MUST contain at least one unique, non-uniform imperfection
that does not repeat across other letters.


COLOR INSTRUCTIONS:
Use a luminous multi-color neon gradient consistent with the reference image.
No flat colors. No monochrome output.

Color transitions must feel organic and painterly,
not mathematically even or uniform.


GLOW & ENERGY:
Glow should be exaggerated, imperfect, and artist-driven.
Overblown bloom, partial clipping, and uneven glow intensity are allowed and encouraged.

Glow is applied AFTER letterform rendering,
not simulated as physically correct light emission.

No flicker.
No procedural distortion artifacts.


LAYOUT:
Center-aligned.
Safe for album cover thumbnails.
Text should feel dynamic, angled, and energetic.


RESTRICTIONS (STRICT):
Do NOT use perfect geometric fonts.
Do NOT resemble neon signs, LED tubes, storefront signage, or clean typography systems.
Do NOT smooth or regularize stroke edges.
Do NOT prioritize physical realism over expressive design.
Do NOT allow background lighting to influence letterform shape.


REFERENCE IMAGES:
{REFERENCE_IMAGES}

The reference images are authoritative.
They define stroke character, edge behavior, motion feel, and overall attitude.
